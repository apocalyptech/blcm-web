# Hello Vault Hunter!

This page aims to be the first stop for folks interested in running mods for
the Borderlands series (primarily for Borderlands 2 + The Pre-Sequel, at the
moment).

# Running Mods

The easiest way to run Borderlands 2 / Pre-Sequel mods is to install the
Borderlands Community Mod Manager, or BLCMM.

BLCMM will take care of hex-editing your game so that the console is
usable for executing mods, and will manage your mods by combining them all
into a single file which can be run once from the BL2/TPS console.

BLCMM will auto-update to the latest version, if needed, from its splash
screen.

# Getting Mods

There are two primary places to acquire mods for BL2 and TPS: Github and
Nexus Mods.  Github has been the primary place to store mods for some time
now, but more modders have been using Nexus recently.

## Github

Mods for both BL2 and TPS are stored [at the BLCMods Github page](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods).
Most users will want to download mods individually, which is unfortunately
not super straightforward.  When you browse to a mod file you want to
download, it will either have a `Raw` button or a `Download` button, in the
upper right hand corner of the file's contents:

[![Download Button](img/github_raw.png)](img/github_raw.png)

Right-click on that button and choose `Save Link As...` to save the file to
your computer, and then use BLCMM to import the mod.

Finding mods on Github is probably its biggest problem, because it's not
easy to browse through the whole repository.  There is a small attempt at
categorizing Github mods on the [ModCabinet wiki](https://github.com/BLCM/ModCabinet/wiki)
but the majority of the Github mods are not found there yet.

## Nexus

Downloading and finding mods on Nexus is more straightforward than on
Github, though you do need an account on Nexus in order to download
mods.
