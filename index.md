# Hello Vault Hunter!

This page aims to be the first stop for folks interested in running mods for
the Borderlands series (primarily for Borderlands 2 + The Pre-Sequel, at the
moment).

# Running Mods

The easiest way to run Borderlands 2 / Pre-Sequel mods is to install the
Borderlands Community Mod Manager, or BLCMM.

{% include youtubeplayer.html id=page.blcmmID %}

BLCMM will take care of hex-editing your game so that the console is
usable for executing mods, and will manage your mods by combining them all
into a single file which can be run once from the BL2/TPS console.

[Click here to download and install BLCMM](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/rsljh5c55s8e9ah/AABMuarIfYCxJb8GiSY1IF6La?dl=0) *(last updated: [fill in a date or something])*

BLCMM will auto-update to the latest version, if needed, from its splash
screen.
