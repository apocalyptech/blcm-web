<h1>Hello Vault Hunter!</h1>

<p>
This page aims to be the first stop for folks interested in running mods for
the Borderlands series (primarily for Borderlands 2 + The Pre-Sequel, at the
moment).  It's maintained by the folks at <a href="/community/">Shadow's Evil
Hideout</a>, so stop by there if you have any questions or suggestions about
the site.
</p>

<p>
The links along the top should get you started with preparing your Borderlands
games for modding, finding mods to use, and running them.  Below, you'll find
any notable larger events which have happened in the modding community
(starting around April 2019).  Click through for more information on those
items as they show up, and subscribe to the RSS feed if you use an RSS reader!
