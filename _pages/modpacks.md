# Major Mod Packs

There are a few "major" mod packs which are popular.  These can often be
used as a "base" modpack, which you can then add more mods to if you like,
though keep in mind that not all mods are compatible, and you may get
unexpected results when using some mods in combination with these.

## Borderlands 2 Unofficial Community Patch (BL2 UCP)

This patch attempts to fix many known issues and bugs in the game as well as
address dozens of gameplay and balance related issues.  It is available from
[Github](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Community%20Patch%20Team)
or [Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/borderlands2/mods/50).

The current version of BL2 UCP is 4.1, and was released in July, 2018.

## Vanilla Enhanced (for Borderlands 2)

Vanilla Enhanced is a pared-down version of UCP which *only* contains bugfixes,
reskins, and some QoL changes, but without trying to affect actual balance or
gameplay.  For someone who is mostly interested in the bugfix aspects of UCP,
but doesn't want any gameplay changes, this may be for you.  Vanilla Enhanced
is available on [Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/borderlands2/mods/88).

## Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel Unofficial Community Patch (TPS UCP)

The TPS UCP has very similar aims as the BL2 UCP.  It is available from
[Github](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Pre%20Sequel%20Mods/Community%20Patch)
or [Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/borderlandspresequel/mods/8).

The current version of TPS UCP is 2.2, and was released in August, 2018.

## BL2 Reborn

If you want to experience Borderlands 2 in a new way, this modpack is exactly
for you. Currently including 155+ mods and over 650 changes!  Note that BL2 Reborn
already includes UCP - you should not try to use both UCP and Reborn at the same
time.  Reborn changes quite a bit about the game, so definitely be careful when
using other mods alongside it.  BL2 Reborn is available on
[Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/borderlands2/mods/115).
