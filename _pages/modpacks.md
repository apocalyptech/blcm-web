# Major Mod Packs

There are a few "major" mod packs which usually serve as a basis for modding.
Many folks will use these as their base patch file and then add more mods to
them as they desire.

## Borderlands 2 Unofficial Community Patch (BL2 UCP)

This patch attempts to fix many known issues and bugs in the game as well as
address dozens of gameplay and balance related issues.  It is available from
[Github](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Community%20Patch%20Team)
or [Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/borderlands2/mods/50).

The current version of BL2 UCP is 4.1, and was released in July, 2018.

## Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel Unofficial Community Patch (TPS UCP)

The TPS UCP has very similar aims as the BL2 UCP.  It is available from
[Github](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Pre%20Sequel%20Mods/Community%20Patch)
or [Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/borderlandspresequel/mods/8).

The current version of TPS UCP is 2.2, and was released in August, 2018.

## BL2 Reborn

If you want to experience Borderlands 2 in a new way, this modpack is exactly
for you. Currently including 155+ mods and over 650 changes!  Note that BL2 Reborn
already includes UCP - you should not try to use both UCP and Reborn at the same
time.  BL2 Reborn is available on [Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/borderlands2/mods/115).
