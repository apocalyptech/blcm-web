# Finding Mods

There are two primary places to acquire mods for BL2 and TPS: Github and
Nexus Mods.  Github has been the primary place to store mods for some time
now, but more modders have been using Nexus recently.

## Github

Mods for both BL2 and TPS are stored [at the BLCMods Github page](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods).
Most users will want to download mods individually, which is unfortunately
not super straightforward.  When you browse to a mod file you want to
download, it will either have a `Raw` button or a `Download` button, in the
upper right hand corner of the file's contents:

[![Raw Button](/img/github_raw.png)](/img/github_raw.png)

[![Download Button](/img/github_download.png)](/img/github_download.png)

Right-click on that button and choose `Save Link As...` to save the file to
your computer, and then use BLCMM to import the mod.

Finding mods on Github is probably its biggest problem, because it's not
easy to browse through the whole repository.  There is a small attempt at
categorizing Github mods on the [ModCabinet wiki](https://github.com/BLCM/ModCabinet/wiki)
but the majority of the Github mods are not found there yet.

## Nexus

Downloading and finding mods on Nexus is more straightforward than on
Github, though you do need an account on Nexus in order to download
mods.
