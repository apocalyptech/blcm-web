# Finding Mods

There are two primary places to acquire mods for BL2 and TPS: Github and
Nexus Mods.  Github has been the primary place to store mods for some time
now, but more modders have been using Nexus recently.

## Github

The ModCabinet wiki is a place where github mods get sorted out into
categories and gives you a nice way to browse through the mods to see
what's there.  You can [find the ModCabinet wiki here](https://github.com/BLCM/ModCabinet/wiki).
The ModCabinet should automatically get updated as modders add or
update mods to the BLCM Github repo.

### Direct Github Access

You can also download mods for both BL2 and TPS directly from
[the BLCMods Github page](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods).
When you browse to a mod file you want to download, it will either have a
`Raw` button or a `Download` button, in the upper right hand corner of the
file's contents:

[![Raw Button](/img/github_raw.png)](/img/github_raw.png)

[![Download Button](/img/github_download.png)](/img/github_download.png)

Right-click on that button and choose `Save Link As...` to save the file to
your computer, and then use BLCMM to import the mod.

## Nexus

Downloading and finding mods on Nexus is more straightforward than on
Github, though you do need an account on Nexus in order to download
mods.
