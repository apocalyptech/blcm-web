# Finding Mods

There are two primary places to acquire mods for BL2 and TPS: Github and
Nexus Mods.  Github has been the primary place to store mods for some time
now, but more modders have been using Nexus recently.

## Github

Mods for both BL2 and TPS are stored [at the BLCMods Github page](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods).
When you browse to a mod file you want to download, it will either have a
`Raw` button or a `Download` button, in the upper right hand corner of the
file's contents:

[![Raw Button](/img/github_raw.png)](/img/github_raw.png)

[![Download Button](/img/github_download.png)](/img/github_download.png)

Right-click on that button and choose `Save Link As...` to save the file to
your computer, and then use BLCMM to import the mod.

### Sorted Github mods at the ModCabinet Wiki

The ModCabinet wiki is a place where github mods get sorted out into
categories and gives you a much nicer way to browse through the mods
to see what's there.  You can [find the ModCabinet wiki here](https://github.com/BLCM/ModCabinet/wiki).

Historically, the ModCabinet wiki wasn't very well populated, since
users had to edit it manually to get mods in there, but on July 19, 
it was updated with an automatic generation process which brings in
the whole github repo.  If you've looked at the wik in the past and
been underwhelmed, give it another look!

## Nexus

Downloading and finding mods on Nexus is more straightforward than on
Github, though you do need an account on Nexus in order to download
mods.
