# Borderlands 1 Modding

[![Borderlands 1 Steam Logo](/img/logo_bl1.jpg)](/img/logo_bl1.jpg)

There's not much information on here about Borderlands 1 modding, at the
moment, since the authors of this page aren't really involved in that
scene.  We'd love to at least add in useful BL1 modding links, though, so
please [let us know](/community/) what content makes sense to have on
here.

As for what's more obviously available via Google:

- A [Borderlands 1 Modding Wiki](http://blmodding.wikidot.com/how-to-mod-it)
  exists, which seems to have a lot of information available on there.

- [Borderlands 1 on Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/borderlands/) is at
  least one place to acquire BL1 mods.

- [The Borderlands "Fan Creations" GBX Forum](https://forums.gearboxsoftware.com/c/borderlands/fan-creations)
  is a place where modders can post and discuss their mods.

For a few links to resources to aid in mod creation, see [BL1 Mod Creation](/bl1-mod-creation).
For links to some of the bigger BL1 mods, see [BL1 Major Mods](/bl1-major-mods).
