This page was created by members of [Shadow's Evil Hideout](/community/),
which is primarily involved with BL2/TPS modding (as opposed to BL1), so
the majority of information on this site is focused on BL2+TPS.  The BL2/TPS
content on here is spread out over these links:

- [Running Mods](/running-mods/): How to manage your mods, hex edit your
  game, and run the mods once you have them installed.
- [Finding Mods](/finding-mods/): Where to find mods and how to download
  them once you've found them.
- [Major Mod Packs](/mod-packs/): Some of the more notable major mod packs
  which are popular with the community.
- [Writing Mods](/writing-mods/): Most information about writing mods is
  hosted elsewhere, but this page will give you some pointers to that
  information.
