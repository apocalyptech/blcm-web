# Major Mods for BL1

This section is still getting populated, obviously, but this page is intended
to have links to a few of the more major mods in the BL1 sphere.

- [The Arsenal](https://forums.gearboxsoftware.com/t/mr-gjs-weapons-items-arsenal-latest-revision-29-04-2018/10007) is
  a mod by Tha Campinâ€™ Dutchman which is fairly extensive and can serve as
  a good introduction for BL1 modding methods, in addition to the functionality
  that it provides on its own.
