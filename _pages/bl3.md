# Borderlands 3 Modding

[![Borderlands 3 Steam Logo](/img/logo_bl3.jpg)](/img/logo_bl3.jpg)

As of late December, 2020, we finally have some user-friendly methods of
running Borderlands 3 mods.  The functionality we have now is roughly the
same as what we had in the pre-SDK days of BL2 and TPS, so things like
a UCP are entirely possible for BL3 now as well.

We've arranged the BL3 Modding information here into a couple different
pages depending on what you're interested in doing.  Click through for
more info!

- [Running Mods](/bl3-running-mods/): How to run Borderlands 3
  mods, using c0dycode's B3HM application.
- [Finding Mods](/bl3-finding-mods/): How to find Borderlands 3 mods to
  use in your game.
- [Writing Mods](/bl3-writing-mods/): Most of the detailed information
  about writing mods is hosted elsewhere, but this page will at least
  give you some pointers to that information.
