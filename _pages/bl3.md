# Borderlands 3 Modding

[![Borderlands 3 Steam Logo](/img/logo_bl3.jpg)](/img/logo_bl3.jpg)

As of late December, 2020, we finally have some user-friendly methods of
running Borderlands 3 mods.  The functionality we have now is roughly the
same as what we had in the pre-SDK days of BL2 and TPS, so writing a mod
like UCP is entirely possible in BL3 (though a BL3 UCP does not yet exist,
nor is one currently in development).

We've arranged the BL3 Modding information here into a couple different
pages depending on what you're interested in doing.  Click through for
more info!

- [Running Mods](/bl3-running-mods/): How to run Borderlands 3
  mods, using c0dycode's B3HM application.
- [Finding Mods](/bl3-finding-mods/): How to find Borderlands 3 mods to
  use in your game.
- [Writing Mods](/bl3-writing-mods/): Most of the detailed information
  about writing mods is hosted elsewhere, but this page will at least
  give you some pointers to that information.

For support with running BL3 Hotfix mods, you can ask on the
[B3HM Nexusmods Page](https://www.nexusmods.com/borderlands3/mods/244), or
free to join [Shadow's Evil Hideout Discord](https://discord.gg/shadowevil)
and ask in the BL3 Modding Help channel there.
