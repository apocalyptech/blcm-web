# Community / Support

## Borderlands 1

- The main community chat area for Borderlands 1 modding is the
  [Borderlands: Community Hangout](https://discord.gg/5pzGb6w) Discord, so
  definitely stop by there if you're interested in getting in to that scene.

## Borderlands 2/TPS

If you have any problems installing or running BL2/TPS mods, please see the
[FAQ](https://bit.ly/2un6scY) first as most questions will be answered there.
For further support, though, see below.

- [Shadow's Evil Hideout](https://discord.gg/shadowevil) is the community
  Discord for [shadowevil](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqhy0tXbMqUrpMTjpv7A9lw).
  It also serves as a home base for UCP development, the home base for management of
  this site, and is a long-running place for BL2/TPS modders to hang out, discuss mods,
  get help with modding, and share their creations.  There's also occasional BL1
  chatter, and a few BL1 modders are around as well.  Stop by and say hello!
  We're a friendly bunch.  There is also a channel for getting help as a user, if
  you're not able to get mods working properly.

- There is a [PythonSDK Discord server](https://discord.gg/VJXtHvh). Most SDK mod
  discussion occurs in this server, as well as some talk about the development of
  the SDK itself.

- A [newer community modding Discord server exists](https://discord.gg/x5uQjE6),
  which was started by Exotek, specifically geared towards BL2/TPS modding (though
  some BL1 talk most likely occurs there as well).

## Other / General

Other communities related to Borderlands modding:

- There's another [Borderlands Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/9dYYN6Y) available
  as well, which appears to have some modding chat on it, though the author of this page
  doesn't really know anything about it.  It appears to be a more general-purpose Borderlands
  Discord, and may have more presence for console users, as opposed to just PC.
