# Community / Support

## Borderlands 1

- The main community chat area for Borderlands 1 modding is the
  [Borderlands: Community Hangout](https://discord.gg/5pzGb6w) Discord, so
  definitely stop by there if you're interested in getting in to that scene.

## Borderlands 2/TPS

If you have any problems installing or running BL2/TPS mods, please see the
[FAQ](https://bit.ly/2un6scY) first as most questions will be answered there.
For further support, though, see below.

- [Shadow's Evil Hideout](https://discord.gg/shadowevil) is the community
  Discord for [shadowevil](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqhy0tXbMqUrpMTjpv7A9lw).
  It also serves as a home base for UCP development, the home base for management of
  this site, and is a long-running place for BL2/TPS (and now BL3) modders to hang
  out, discuss mods, get help with modding, and share their creations.  There's also
  occasional BL1 chatter, and a few BL1 modders are around as well.  Stop by and say hello!
  We're a friendly bunch.  There is also a channel for getting help as a user, if
  you're not able to get mods working properly.

- There is a [PythonSDK Discord server](https://discord.gg/VJXtHvh). Most SDK mod
  discussion occurs in this server, as well as some talk about the development of
  the SDK itself.

- A [newer community modding Discord server exists](https://discord.gg/x5uQjE6),
  which was started by Exotek, specifically geared towards BL2/TPS modding (though
  some BL1 talk most likely occurs there as well).

## Borderlands 3

Borderlands 3 modding is still in very early days, so expect there to be some hiccups
as more and more people start using the software and mods.  There are a few places
to go for help with doing BL3 hotfix modding, though:

- The [B3HM Nexusmods Page](https://www.nexusmods.com/borderlands3/mods/244) can
  be used to report bugs or ask for help running it.

- As mentioned above, [Shadow's Evil Hideout Discord](https://discord.gg/shadowevil)
  has been the home base for many of the folks who have been involved with BL3 Modding
  thus far.  Feel free to check that out and ask in the BL3 Modding Help channel, if
  you're having problems.

## Other / General

Other communities related to Borderlands modding:

- There's another [Borderlands Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/9dYYN6Y) available
  as well, which appears to have some modding chat on it, though the author of this page
  doesn't really know anything about it.  It appears to be a more general-purpose Borderlands
  Discord, and may have more presence for console users, as opposed to just PC.
