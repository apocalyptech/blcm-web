# Community / Support

If you have any problems installing or running  these mods please see the [FAQ](https://bit.ly/2un6scY)
first as most questions will be answered there. For further support see below.

The place which serves as a home base for UCP development, and is a long-running place for
BL2/TPS modders to hang out, discuss mods, get help with modding, and share their creations,
is the [Shadow's Evil Hideout](https://discord.gg/0YjZxbVBS9b3bXUS) Discord.  Stop by and
say hello!  We're a friendly bunch.  There is also a channel for getting help as a user, if
you're not able to get mods working properly.  It's also this community which manages this
website.

BL2 Reborn has [their own Discord server as well](https://discord.gg/Rakbg5F).

There's another [Borderlands Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/9dYYN6Y) available
as well, which appears to have some modding chat on it, though the author of this page
doesn't really know anything about it.  It appears to be a more general-purpose Borderlands
Discord.
