# Community / Support

If you have any problems installing or running  these mods please see the [FAQ](https://bit.ly/2un6scY)
first as most questions will be answered there. For further support see bellow.

The longest-running place for BL2/TPS modders to hang out, discuss mods, get help with
modding, and share their creations, is the [Shadow's Evil Hideout](https://discord.gg/0YjZxbVBS9b3bXUS)
discord channel.  Stop by and say hello!  We're a friendly bunch.  There is also
a channel for getting help as a user, if you're not able to get mods working properly.

BL2 Reborn has [their own Discord server as well](https://discord.gg/Rakbg5F).

The community which set up this server doesn't do much with Borderlands 1 modding, but
there is a [Bordlerands 1 Modding Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/9dYYN6Y) available
as well.
