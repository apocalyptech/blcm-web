# Community / Support

If you have any problems installing or running BL2/TPS modsl, please see the
[FAQ](https://bit.ly/2un6scY) first as most questions will be answered there.
For further support, though, see below.

[Shadow's Evil Hideout](https://discord.gg/0YjZxbVBS9b3bXUS) is a Discord server which
serves as a home base for UCP development, the home base for management of this site, and
is a long-running place for BL2/TPS modders to hang out, discuss mods, get help with
modding, and share their creations.  Stop by and say hello!  We're a friendly bunch.
There is also a channel for getting help as a user, if you're not able to get mods
working properly.

Other Discord servers related to Borderlands modding:

- BL2 Reborn has [their own Discord server](https://discord.gg/Rakbg5F).

- There's another [Borderlands Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/9dYYN6Y) available
  as well, which appears to have some modding chat on it, though the author of this page
  doesn't really know anything about it.  It appears to be a more general-purpose Borderlands
  Discord, and may have more presence for console users, as opposed to just PC.

- A newer community Discord server [also exists](https://discord.gg/x5uQjE6), specifically
  geared towards BL2/TPS modding, like Shadow's Evil Hideout.
