# BL2 + TPS Modding Broken For The Time Being

Today (February 27, 2020), [Gearbox patched both Borderlands 2 and The Pre-Sequel](https://steamcommunity.com/games/49520/announcements/detail/1707365591060869371)
with some changes which adds support for upcoming cross-play between
various PC-based platforms.  

As a result of this patch, our current methods for hex-editing the
games no longer work properly, so at the moment there is no way to
run mods in BL2 and TPS.  Rest assured that modders are looking into
this, so hopefully we'll have some news before too long, though there
is no ETA for when it might be fixed.
