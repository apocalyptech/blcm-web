# Borderlands 3 Modding (with B3HM) Now Available!

It's been a long time coming, but thanks to the intrepid efforts of
c0dycode and a growing number of folks who've been testing out his
code, we're thrilled to announce that a user-friendly way of running
mods for Borderlands 3 is now available!  The app which makes it
possible is called B3HM.

You can read about running BL3 Mods yourself on our [Running BL3 Mods](/bl3-running-mods)
page, but the gist is that you first need to download c0dycode's
app "B3HM", which can be found at either of:

- [B3HM at Nexusmods](https://www.nexusmods.com/borderlands3/mods/244)
- [B3HM at Github Releases](https://github.com/c0dycode/BL3HotfixWebUI/releases)

Once you've got B3HM set up and doing its thing, you'll want to find
some mods to use.  The [Running BL3 Mods](/bl3-running-mods) has some
more details on that as well, but the best place to look at the moment
is the [BL3 ModCabinet Wiki](https://github.com/BLCM/bl3mods/wiki).

If you have trouble getting BL3 modding going, feel free to join *mumblemumble*
