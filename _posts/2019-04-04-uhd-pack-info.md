# Current State of BL2+TPS Modding, post-UHD DLC

Yesterday, on April 3, Gearbox released UHD Packs, or "Ultra
High-Definition Texture Packs" for both Borderlands 2 and TPS.
They're available for free for all BL2+TPS users as a DLC
download:

- <https://store.steampowered.com/app/941170/Borderlands_2_Ultra_HD_Texture_Pack/>
- <https://store.steampowered.com/app/941180/Borderlands_The_PreSequel_Ultra_HD_Texture_Pack/>

Along with those updates, though, the main EXE files for
both games was updated, which broke BLCMM's ability to apply
hex-edits.

At the moment, a new version of BLCMM is still forthcoming,
but there are some other ways to hex-edit your game, at least
for BL2 (the Pre-Sequel is still in a somewhat weird state
though).

- One option is to use the original manual hex-editing method,
  as described [on youtube by Shadowevil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_ee3BM1TQQ),
  or [on the BLCM wiki](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/wiki/Tutorial%3A-Enabling-Console).

- Another is to use the new beta version of c0dycode's "Hex
  Multitool", [which is available here](https://github.com/c0dycode/Borderlands-Hex-Multitool/files/3041649/BL.Hex-Multitool.NET.4.5.-.UHD.Beta.zip).  If you encounter problems with that
  release, please [submit an Issue to c0dycode's github Issue tracker](https://github.com/c0dycode/Borderlands-Hex-Multitool/issues).
  Note that TPS support for this is still a bit iffy, and
  might potentially not work at the moment.

You can expect that the next few days might remain a little
chaotic for BL2+TPS modding, of course, but with either of
those methods, you *should* be able to get your BL2+TPS
mods working again for the time being.
