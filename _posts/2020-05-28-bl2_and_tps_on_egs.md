# BL2 and TPS Available on Epic Games Store

Today, Borderlands 2 and Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel were released on
Epic Games Store.  They're available for free, with all available DLCs,
for some period of time, so feel free to pick them up if you don't already
have them!

In terms of modding, it looks like mods will continue to work just fine
on the Epic version, but at the moment you'll need to use Hex Multitool to
do the hex editing, instead of BLCMM.  BLCMM still needs to be updated to
support the new Epic versions.

You can acquire Hex Multitool at the usual locations:

- [Download Hex Multitool 1.34 on Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/borderlands2/mods/54/?tab=description)
- [Download Hex Multitool 1.34 on Github](https://github.com/c0dycode/Borderlands-Hex-Multitool)
