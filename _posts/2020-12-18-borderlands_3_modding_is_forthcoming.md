# Borderlands 3 Modding is Forthcoming

It's been a long time coming, but thanks to the intrepid efforts of
c0dycode and a growing number of folks who've been testing out his
code, we're thrilled to announce that a user-friendly way of running
mods for Borderlands 3 will be released shortly, on December 24, 2020.

Exciting times!  This site will be updated with some more detailed
information once B3HM has been released, including links to all
relevant software, and ways to find BL3 mods.

Happy Vault Hunting!
