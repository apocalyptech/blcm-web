# SHIFT Issues with Modding - BL2 + TPS

For about a week now, loading BL2 and Pre-Sequel mods has been problematic
for various users thanks to some apparent changes in how Gearbox is
providing hotfixes to the games.  Users won't get an error on the console
when executing the patch, but will notice that they don't have the "Running
UCP" notification on the BAR screens, and many changes from the patch won't
be applying properly.

The solution for this is to switch your patch to "offline" mode.  BLCMM
can do this very easily: open your patch file in BLCMM, check the "offline"
checkbox at the bottom of the screen, and then re-save the file.  When you
re-execute the patch on the main menu, it should apply properly.  Note that
"offline" in this context *only* means the SHIFT components -- you can still
play coop with your friends while using an "offline" version of your patch
file.

If you're using just the BL2 UCP, a pre-saved offline patch is available
at both [Github](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Community%20Patch%20Team)
and [Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/borderlands2/mods/50).
